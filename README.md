# Production
Production grammar system in Swift 2.3

*A production or production rule in computer science is a rewrite rule specifying a symbol substitution that can be recursively performed to generate new symbol sequences. A finite set of productions is the main component in the specification of a formal grammar (specifically a generative grammar).*

I've always been interested in using Production Rules to do proving of hypotheses. When Swift first came out I was
interested in learning how to use the language. This was a very simple Production Rule system ( with GUI ) that I wrote
to learn how Swift worked and to see how Swift interfaces with Cocoa. I updated it to work with Swift 2.3 ( and maybe, one
day in the future I will update it to work with a more recent version of Swift ).
